# Neutron Star Max Mass
This project constructs the Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff equations and numerically calcualtes the maximum mass of white dwarf stars under various different models.

It outputs the maximum mass and creates plots of the masses and radius.

The Theoretical paper accompanying this project delves into the technical detail behind this project
